# EH5 - A Lightweight, Modern Frontend Framework for Web Applications

eh5 is a minimalist yet powerful JavaScript framework designed to simplify web development by providing a set of intuitive, chainable DOM manipulation methods and pre-built UI components. Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, eh5 offers a lightweight alternative to larger frameworks while maintaining modern development patterns.

Mobile-first Design - Responsive layouts with proper viewport meta tags and touch-friendly interactions
Customizable Styling - Chainable style methods and CSS utilities with built-in hover effects
Lightweight Architecture - No dependencies, minimal footprint (~20KB uncompressed)
Modern JavaScript - Uses ES6+ features including classes, arrow functions, and template literals
Animation Support - Built-in animation helpers for smooth transitions and effects


## Component Library Includes:

Form controls (text inputs, checkboxes, switches, dropdowns)
Buttons (regular, line, icon)
Layout systems (vertical/horizontal layouts, scroll views)
Feedback components (toasts, dialogs, loading indicators)
Navigation elements (tabs, steppers)
Utility methods (debouncing, color manipulation)
